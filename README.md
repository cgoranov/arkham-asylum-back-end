# Arkham Asylum

Arkham Asylum is a interactive experience for the die-hard Batman fans! Arkham Asylum page will show you fun facts about the currently captured criminals while the Most Wanted page will allow you to add any rogues you do not see locked up! 

## Overview

Arkham Asylum was created with a React/Redux frontend and Ruby on Rails API backend. I hope you enjoy!
